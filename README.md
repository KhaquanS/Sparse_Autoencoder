# Overview
This repo presents a very simplistic implementation of the Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE). The SAE are a class of regularised Auto-Encoders which provide the following major benefit:
* SAEs introdue a sparsity contraint on the latent space representation of the input data learnt by the encoder. This contraint mainly prevents the latent space from being a naive 'copy' of the input data.
